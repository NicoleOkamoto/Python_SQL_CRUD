## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Install the Pandas library if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Usage

   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform CRUD operations.

## Visualizing the Database
You can use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite to visualize the database created by the application. Download and install DB Browser from [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), then open the `database.db` file in the project directory.
